Website performance is a critical factor in SEO and user retention. In 2025, Google and users expect lightning-fast load times. Here's how to stay ahead:

- Use modern image formats like WebP and AVIF  
- Implement lazy loading for images and videos  
- Reduce JavaScript bundle sizes  
- Use server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)  
- Enable compression (Gzip/Brotli)  
- Adopt a Content Delivery Network (CDN)  
- Monitor with tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest

Faster websites mean better engagement and higher conversion rates.
