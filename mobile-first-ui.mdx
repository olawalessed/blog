With over 70% of global traffic now mobile, designing with a mobile-first approach is no longer optional. Best practices include:

- Responsive grids and fluid typography  
- Touch-friendly navigation and UI elements  
- Prioritizing speed and accessibility  
- Testing across real devices  
- Minimal pop-ups and distractions  
- Embracing progressive web app (PWA) features

Think mobile-first, not mobile-friendly.
