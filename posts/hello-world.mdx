# Welcome to Your New Blog

This is your first blog post, written in Markdown and rendered with MDX. You can use all the standard Markdown syntax you're familiar with.

## What's Included?

This blog platform has been built with:

- **Next.js** - A React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **MDX** - For enhanced Markdown with components
- **Dark Mode** - For comfortable reading day and night

## Code Highlighting

```tsx
// Example React component
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
